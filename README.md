## Description
<!-- TODO - How have you solved the problem? -->
my_bsq -- finds and prints the biggest square in a map

- 1.Retreive size of input map from 1st line.
- 2.Build a 2D matrix for dynamic programming.
- 2.Write result into a a char buffer.

## Installation
<!-- TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re? -->
Build system dependency: `make`
`make`: build target `my_bsq`.
`make clean`: clean temporary obj files.
`make fclean`: clean temporary obj files and target.
`make re`: clean and rebuild the program from scratch.
